## Worked on HTML Plugin 
The project introduced a lot of challenges which included analyzing the black box document generation and creating complex algorithms which could be used to convert <div> based Web HTML into <table> based Email compatible HTML.

Learnt and participated in creating the roadmap which included the blockers, milestones and delivery dates.
