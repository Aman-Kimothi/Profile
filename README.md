The idea aimed at improving guest experience at hotels and optimizing hotel operations/resource utilization by digitizing various processes through IoT, kiosk and chatbot integration. 
Learnt a lot about how to present a business idea and add value to the organization.

<br>

## Worked on HTML Plugin 
The project introduced a lot of challenges which included analyzing the black box document generation and creating complex algorithms which could be used to convert div based Web HTML into table based Email compatible HTML.<br>
It gave an opportunity to work on a research type of project where we had to study a black box and create a PoC to show the feasibility of the project. Development was done from scratch and the project has been delivered in PRD.
Learnt and participated in creating the roadmap which included the blockers, milestones and delivery dates.<br>
